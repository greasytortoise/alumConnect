I really love tech and science. Any type of innovation gets my geekyenergy rolling. Star Trek fans anyone? I always had this fascination with tech that contributes to the betterment of mankind. I am big fan of Tesla, and it's these type of people who inspire me and to 'never stay comfortable in life.' I always want to have goals, and not live day by day. I can't forget Neil Degrasse Tyson, Michio Kaku, and BillNye (Bill Bill Bill)! They really contribute to making science cool. In the near future, I really want to get into robotics. I think it is the future, especially the medical augmentation aspect (maybe even augmentation addict centers, a good idea for you! lol).


Coding experience?
 None. I started to learn in April, but that is about it. I was kind of on and off, then I got serious. To be honest, I really wished I went into this field a lot earlier. I just had this imposter syndrome that this is the field of geniuses. However, I realize anyone can do anything as long as you stay on course and stay passionate. Better late than never.


Fun random stuff?
Not much to say as I stayed indoor most of the time lol. I played a lot of video games from Atari, Genesis, to the PS4! Occasionally, I would go outdoor with my father as he likes to hunt Boars, Bears, and Deer. I don't like hunting, but I do sometimes reload ammo for for my dad lol. Also, I had many pets, especially hunting dogs. So far, I have had pet Snakes, Mice, Guinea pigs, lizards, fishes, Cherokee birds, many dogs and cats, piglets, and even a pigeon! Currently, I have 4 dogs; They are 2 Walker hounds, Maltese and a Chihuahua. Recently, I got really into whiskey.

My favorite thing about tech is how we continue to compact and lessen the need for hardware and bulk. The less money we need to spend updating hefty hardware and the less space we need to store it, the better things are! I'm also interesting in AI and cyber security, but I don't know too much about either. Maybe those are some good learning projects postHR :)


Coding experience?
I had never even heard of most programming languages a little over a year ago (I was planning on studying English and foreign languages). I started trying to learn ObjectiveC to build an app right before Swift was released, but I realized I was in way over my head, so I took two intro classes in Java and C++. I also did a few courses online with Udacity for FrontEnd Web Dev, as well as courses on Code School and other free online classes.

I'm Sondra Silverhawk.


What have you been up to before Hack Reactor?
I studied Environmental Science in college, then went for a PhD in biology, but had to leave the program early because of a death in the family. I was able to finish a masters, and then I took some time off to figure out what I wanted to do next. Academia no longer appealed, there weren't many interesting private sector opportunities for biologists, and I was burnt out on it, anyway. I did some writing, worked as an editor for a while, improved my cooking skills, and taught myself to code. Surprisingly coding was the thing I enjoyed most, and since the job prospects are great, it was the clear winner.


What city are you coming from to be here at HR?
I currently live in Portland.


Tech interests?
I'm still exploring all the possibilities. So far I'm really interested in machine learning and natural language processing. I did the machine learning class on Coursera, and it was mindbending. I loved it.


Coding experience?
I took a class in grad school that focused on the use of Matlab in biomedical engineering. The professor gave us some code to hack on, and after the class I wanted to learn more so I downloaded Stanford's CS106A, an intro to computer science in Java. After I finished that I went through Learn Python the Hard Way, and did an evening class here in Portland, at Epicodus. At this point I've done the beginner stuff to death, and am looking forward to more advanced challenges at Hack Reactor.


Fun random stuff?
I do a lot of reading and I love to travel. A few years ago I played Earthbound for the first time, and after I beat it I played it through again. The world is so unique, and the game play is simple but satisfying. Since then I've been thinking about making my own oldschool RPG, but too many projects, too little time. I also love Katamari Damacy. It's brilliant.

Nick Echols (EK HOLS)


What have you been up to before Hack Reactor?
I've been working as a cook(and a lot of other things) for a small takeout restaurant in Berkeley for the last four years. Also playing in a crappy
rock and roll band at sparsely attended bar shows, and watching better bands perform at better venues :P


What city are you coming from to be here at HR?
Oakland


Tech interests?
I'm very interested in using tech in art/music/immersion/entertainment/experience, and other words like that. I would like to help make magical, otherworldly experiences with people who are more artistically creative than I am.
Of course this includes things like arduino, and other stuff that makes flashes and beeps. On a related note, I spend a lot of my free time on instructables
Also, I hope to do notevil (even notdouchey if that's possible) things with my programming skills coming out of HR


Coding experience?
I took an intro to computer science course my first quarter of UCSD, fell in love with programming, and did a lot more throughout my time there, minoring in CS. After that, I decided I needed a big change, so I didn't pursue a techrelated career. I did keep learning on my own though, and picked up a few new programming skills and languages on the way. I ultimately decided that I seriously enjoy this stuff and I wanna dive in and actually make a career out of it.


Fun random stuff?
This is the hardest one. Does anyone else feel like they're writing a weird okcupid profile?
  Anyway, I like surfing too, and haven't gone in a tragically long time, so those who mentioned it above (and anyone else too), let's go!




Thomas Hoffman

Thomas Hoffmann


What have you been up to before Hack Reactor?
This past Spring I graduated from the University of Maine with a B.S. in Bioengineering. I originally intended to continue on to medical school, but ultimately decided it just wasn’t something I was passionate about. Since then, while halfheartedly applying to a variety of jobs, I started to get more into programming, eventually realizing it was something I wanted to pursue more seriously.


What city are you coming from to be here at HR?
Hampden, Maine (definitely looking forward to the change in weather).


Tech interests?
There are many tech areas I find interesting, such as cybersecurity, the intersection of biology and technology, machine learning, gaming, software
development (applications and systems), and augmented reality, among others. I hope to learn more about my interests and hopefully find one I am passionate about.


Coding experience?
I began programming near the end college by teaching myself the basics of Python. While I enjoyed it, I never really did much with it. Other than that, the majority of my coding experience has been learning HTML/CSS and Javascript over the past 34 months.

 
Fun random stuff?
I am a very active person and love learning to play new sports (always wanted to surf!). I also like reading, traveling, video games, watching sports, and grabbing a drink with friends.

My name's Franklin Shieh. I go by Frank. Last name is pronounced like "Shay".


What have you been up to before Hack Reactor?
I just graduated from USC in December 2015 having studied Business Administration for 3.5 years. I've spent the last two summers interning at Barclays Investment Bank in their Menlo Park Technology Coverage group supporting the team on mergers & acquisitions and capital raises.


What city are you coming from to be here at HR?
I've been living in Los Angeles from 2012now, but I'm originally from Palo Alto.


Tech interests?
I think there's still too much about tech that I don't know about, so I can't say for sure what I'm most interested in yet. But at the moment, I'd love to explore more in automation, machine learning, SaaS and the sharing economy (to put it in buzzwords).


Coding experience?
Zero; before selfstudying through online resources, the only "coding" experience I had was writing an IF statement in excel and copypasting someone else's VBA code.


Fun random stuff?
I enjoy running/road cycling/weightlifting, so am looking for a workout partner. I sometimes play saxophone/clarinet and am a big fan of jazz music. Also very interested in exploring the city.

The last four years I spent working in corporate travel.


What city are you coming from to be here at HR?
I was born and raised in Bulgaria. The last five years I have been living in San Francisco.


Tech interests?
If we define "tech interest" as something that I like hearing or reading about, then too many. Here are some:
● Any technology that can displace the big banks. ●
● Any technology that can displace oil and coal like nuclear, solar, wind etc. ●
● Everything automotive, especially car design, electric vehicles and selfdriving cars. ●


Coding experience?
I did some coding in Pascal back in highschool and found it really interesting. Some experience with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. My main goal with joining Hack Reactor is to finally advance one of my "interests" into a vocation.


Fun random stuff?
If I was left alone on an island with a lot of books and drawing supplies, I would probably fail to notice that people are missing.




Victoria Tran

Hi everyone! My name is Victoria Tran  Pretty
straightforward


What have you been up to before Hack Reactor?
I was majoring in psychology at a community college in Orange County, but decided to take a break from school to save up money. I moved up to the bay area about 1.5 years ago & heard about HR through a friend & decided to take the plunge.


What city are you coming from to be here at HR?
Huntington Beach to San Leandro to San Francisco! :)
  Jobwise? As of now, I would like to be making games in the future, but I haven't really exposed myself to all the other options. There's just so many!


Tech interests?


Coding experience?
Does Xanga count? After I discovered HR, I studied from the ground up for about a year before I felt comfortable applying. Selftaught JS, HMTL, CSS, & some Ruby.


Fun random stuff?
I love reading. Mostly scifi or fantasy, but I'm open to suggestions! I also love singing & playing my ukulele when I have the urge to learn a new song. I started taking Brazilian JiuJitsu classes last year, but ultimately took a break because of work & studies, so I'm excited to get back into it after HR!
COFFEE.. I love coffee!! Tea is cool too

Colin Whitmarsh (WITmarsh)


What have you been up to before Hack Reactor?
Since graduating college in 2011, I've been working in renewables (energy efficiency,
solar, and wind) and have been coming to terms with the fact I like burritos almost as much as pizza. Sometimes the decision is too overwhelming and I have a milkshake.


What city are you coming from to be here at HR?
Berkeley. I lived in DC for a few years and then moved to Berkeley last fall to be closer to family.


Tech interests?
I'm interested in software that makes clean energy cheaper and easier to implement. I'm also interested in machine learning and how it can be used to help the grid be more efficient and integrate with more renewable sources.


Coding experience?

What city are you coming from to be here at HR?
I've been in Oakland for a few years now. I'll be commuting via BART, from MacArthur station


Tech interests?
the Internet of Things, data visualizations (d3!), and anything that will help cities be more sustainable in the wake of the continuing influx of urban populations. AI (and AI r isk! ) is on my radar, though, because of this great WaitButWhy post on S uper Intelligence and why EVERYBODY should care.


Coding experience?
Zero, before questioning my career. Did Codecademy,
CodeSchool, FreeCodeCamp, CodeWars, etc. and I'm really excited about creating/building digital spaces!


Fun random stuff?
I love anything outdoors  camping, hiking and swimming in the summer, snowboarding in the winter. I have an awesome rabbit (pet) named Domino. I weld, mostly gas(Oxy/Acetylene) and TIG, and I like to build things.

Grew up in northern West Virginia. Have
 lived in the DC metro for the past 6 years.


Tech interests?
I have a strong interest in SaaS platforms and building tools to solve real world business problems. In general, I like solving problems and as long as the problem is interesting and worth solving, I can get excited about it.


Coding experience?
I planned on attending HR a year ago, but my company let me transition to software so I postponed my enrollment. I've been writing C# and SQL for the past ~8 months. Its been mostly backend work so I'm excited to dive into the frontend.


Fun random stuff?
I got engaged in September; hopefully my fiancee will still be waiting for me when I finish HR. I enjoy hiking, mountain biking and concerts in my spare time.




Jarrett Gliner


Preferred name (first and last, and proper pronunciation for either or both if needed  it helps so much!)
Jarrett Gliner  Easy to pronounce, confusing to spell!


What have you been up to before Hack Reactor?
I graduated from UC Santa Barbara in 2014, with a BA in Psychology and a minor in Technology Management and Entrepreneurship. I had always known I wanted to work in Tech, and even taught myself a bit of coding in High School, but I was initially more interested in the business/marketing side of the industry. After taking a Python course in college, I realized that coding was actually my passion and that I should have majored in CS all along. Unfortunately, it was too late at that point to change.
After graduating, I went on to work at a Santa Barbarabased midstage startup called FindTheBest (now called Graphiq) as a Product Manager. I was stoked that the role was relatively technical, but after a year of working there, I knew I had to dive headfirst into the real deal and become a developer.


What city are you coming from to be here at HR?
Santa Barbara (grew up in San Diego).


Tech interests?
One of my goals in being a developer is to improve how we socialize in the age of “always on” by 1) using technology as a tool for socializing rather than a distraction from it, and 2) giving longtime connections who would not ordinarily interact a more natural way to keep in touch. Expanding on the first point: while it’s disappointing that casual group gettogethers can have periods where everyone is silently checking their phones, there’s more we can do than just removing the phones from the equation. A game like Q uiplash (which I'm always down to play if we ever have time) already does a great job of this, but there are not many other applications that have people interacting in the same way. For the second point, activities such as Fantasy Sports can keep a group connected despite their distance and differing schedules. However, in order to make that possible, everyone in the group must have a mutual interest in the sport, so there is room to expand that concept as well.


Coding experience?
I taught myself HTML/CSS and took a class in Python. At FindTheBest, my role required me to learn mySQL/Database management and basic JS, as well as a funky “visualprogramming” application called Pentaho Data Integration (imagine a highlevel language like Python or JS, but instead of typing code, you drag and connect boxes on a grid that represent various functions).


Fun random stuff?
I’m into pretty much any hobby that involves creativity. Whether it’s playing/producing music, cooking, writing, messing around in Photoshop, or even video games, I love turning nothing into something. Besides that, I’m a Football nut (even though being a Chargers fan is... difficult at times). Also, I’m all about craft beer and whiskey.




Anthony Salierno


Preferred name (first and last, and proper pronunciation for either or both if needed  it helps so much!)
Anthony Salierno. I don't really pronounce the "i" in my last name, so I say it like suhLAIRno.


What have you been up to before Hack Reactor?
Most recently I worked as an analyst at Bridgewater Associates, a hedge fund in Westport, CT. Prior to that I worked as an analyst at BMO Capital Markets, an investment bank in New York City. Before that I graduated from Villanova University in 2010 having majored in finance and accounting. I knew finance wasn't what I really wanted to do longterm and after becoming more and more obsessed with tech and the future every day for the past few years I finally found out about Hack Reactor and was ecstatic to follow a path that made sense to me.
 

What city are you coming from to be here at HR?
I moved from NYC where I've lived for the past five years since graduating from college.


Tech interests?
1.) Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning 2.) Human Longevity and Medical Innovation 3.) Space Exploration and Colonization
I'm really interested in being part of building a better future. People have never been more empowered than now to take part in improving the world and I want to make a contribution that I'm proud of. If anyone is interested in the future and what it might look like I plan on starting a meet up group in SF after Hack Reactor ends (when we have lives again haha) for entrepreneurially minded people who think longterm so I hope to see some of you there!


Coding experience?
I basically started from scratch to get into Hack Reactor. I had tried a Swift course a year earlier but didn't stick with it because I couldn't make time.


Fun random stuff?
I enjoy working out and have become a big fan of meditation and yoga over the past couple of years. I'm also very interested in the future of humanity, the universe / space, evolution and psychology.




Joshua Sheller


Preferred name (first and last, and proper pronunciation for either or both if needed  it helps so much!) Joshua Sheller. Most call me Sheller, but Josh or Joshua are both just as well to me.


What have you been up to before Hack Reactor?
I graduated from Pepperdine University with a Business Major and Applied Math Minor in 2012. For the past couple of years I’ve been running a lab for a startup working to perfect a process dealing with fractional distillation and gas chromatography (just a fancy way of saying separating and analyzing oils we are distilling). Fingers crossed some of our work will make a real difference for those fighting multiple sclerosis, alzheimer’s, certain types of cancer, and some other very ugly stuff.


What city are you coming from to be here at HR?
I was born and raised in a small town in Iowa, moved to CA for college, and have been back and forth between the east
and west coast a few times since. I’m currently coming from visiting family in Mason City, Iowa.


Tech interests?
After reading about / playing around with some Javascript and Ruby/Rails I realized that the numbers we put together through excel sheets in our most recent lab work (which took us several months) could have been analyzed in days, minutes, or less. Blew my mind! I’m fascinated by the ability of 20 lines of code to reach 20 million people and can’t wait to learn more about data analysis, and any other area of Javascript with the potential to make a positive dent in the universe!


Coding experience?
After college I helped build the “coding” side of my sister’s startup (Nearly Newlywed  check us out on Shark Tank!). This was mostly only html/css with a bit of the Shopify templating language Liquid. I also recently finished a very rough first draft of a poker odds training / analysis “app” if anyone is into cards. That is about it, so I’ll be playing catch up with all of you.


Fun random stuff?
I love to backpack and explore the world / other ways of life. I enjoy reading / hiking / lifting / anything active. I try to surround myself with people smarter than me, and I’ve just met forty plus of you, so I look forward to learning from all of you!




Orlando Castillo


Preferred name (first and last, and proper pronunciation for either or both if needed  it helps so much!)
Orlando Castillo (The double L's in my last name are pronounced like a Y). My nickname is Lance, and a lot of my friends call me that, but Lance or Orlando (or any other variant of that, I get Lando sometimes from Star Wars fans) is good with me!  


What have you been up to before Hack Reactor?
I just graduated this past May from University of Pennsylvania with a degree in Biophysics. Since then, I have been working as a Research Technician at the Children's Hospital of Pennsylvania on a project involved in the creation of an "artificial womb" for premature babies. While working there, my main responsibilities involved improving their data management and analysis for the project, using VBScript, HTML, some JavaScript, and Excel to streamline their data input and subsequent calculation process. I also had to help take care of the baby lambs they were using to model a human fetus. I used to be Premed, but my persistent hobby for topics in computer science along with the work I've been doing as a member of this research team has reinforced the idea that a career in computer science may be more suited to my passions and talents than one in medicine!


What city are you coming from to be here at HR?
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (I've lived here all my life, so I'm really excited to live in a new environment!)


Tech interests?
I've always been interested in computer science. When I was younger, I was really interested in trying to build an iPhone App, so I learned C on my Macbook and then ObjectiveC before playing around with Cocoa to build very basic apps. Later on in college, I would often take study breaks by taking courses on Codeacademy or reading online about some computer topic simply because it allowed my mind to switch gears from whatever I was studying at the moment and I always found the content stimulating. Lately, I've been trying to play around with Linux distros, it's my first time using them so right now I'm running an Ubuntu distro.


Coding experience?
I taught myself C and ObjectiveC in high school. I took an intro to Computer Science Course as an undergraduate where I learned some Java. A lot of my physics classes required me to program in Matlab with some Python occasionally thrown in as part of my studies. I've been studying codeacademy and, in order to write scripts with the software my research team uses for data capture, I've learned VBscript, HTML, Javascript, and CSS. Lastly, recently I've started teaching myself Haskell, because as a functional programming language it requires you to think differently about how you write programs and I think that adopting a different perspective in the way you program can be helpful to solving problems. Additionally, from what I hear, there seems to be a lot of talk about functional programming vs. imperative programming, so I feel like having a bit of experience with both can be valuable.


Fun random stuff?
I'm a pretty big Star Wars fun, so I've really been enjoying all the hype that's coming back to the stories with the new movie that came out. I also recently started to engage in a more active lifestyle so I always try and work out every day. Lastly, I'm a big reader, so I always enjoy talking about a good book or new novel if anyone every has any suggestions. I'm so excited to meet everyone and look forward to staying in SF!




Kyle Corbelli


Preferred name (first and last, and proper pronunciation for either or both if needed  it helps so much!)
Hi everyone, my name is Kyle Corbelli. Nothing crazy about the pronunciation.


What have you been up to before Hack Reactor?
Working, hiking, surfing, coding, road tripping (I'm typing this right now in a cozy snowcovered bungalow in Utah). But as far as all the professional stuff goes, I started working as an actuarial analyst right out of college and somehow found my way into sales. It's been fun but I'm not quite extroverted enough to want to pack in 30 years of that whole thing.


What city are you coming from to be here at HR?
I spent my first couple decades living the Bay Area (Petaluma then Berkeley then Oakland) but have most recently been living in San Diego. It'll be weird at Hack Reactor to be the only guy in the cohort coming from Southern California who likes to hike and surf.


Tech interests?
A few concrete topics I think I might enjoy include data science, modeling, machine learning, building tools, and wellintentioned applications aimed at making people happy. Really though, I just like developing software applications. I like the process itself: the focus, the freedom, the challenge, the creation, the headphones, the coffee.


Coding experience?
I majored in Math at Cal with a concentration in Stat so I had a lot of fun with Matlab, R, and C. My first realworld "program" was a data analysis and visualization tool I wrote in VBA during an actuarial internship. What I wouldn't give to see that mess of code today. Over the past year or so I've been teaching myself the web technologies, built a couple things for work, and deployed a little mobilefriendly MEANstack web app that I use in my daytoday. For the last few weeks I've been working through a book on Java to up my OO game and get some experience with a statically typed language.

Liz Mallalieu


Preferred name (first and last, and proper pronunciation for either or both if needed  it helps so much!)
Elizabeth Mallalieu. Most people call me Liz, but anything works :)


What have you been up to before Hack Reactor? I graduated from Colgate University in 2013 with a degree in Economics, but decided to go a different route after college working for a small electronic music startup doing a little bit of everything from editorial and content creation to media partnerships with festivals and event ticketing. The website didn’t work very well causing a lot of problems for us, so I ended up learning a bit about the web. After that, I decided I wanted to move to the engineering side of startups and started to learn coding on my own. During this time, I did an internship at Foursquare in product ops, which solidified my desire to become a full time programmer.


What city are you coming from to be here at HR?
NYC. I’m definitely looking forward to escaping the cold winter this year!


Tech interests?
I have recently become interested in blockchain technology, specifically the ways it can be applied to so many different industries. It’s a really interesting time to become a programmer, and I’m excited to be a part of it!


Coding experience?
I did some very basic programming in SAS and Stata to work with data sets for an econometrics course in college, but didn’t do much beyond that until I started exploring the many online resources about a year ago to see if coding was something I actually wanted to pursue as a career. I didn’t get too serious with it until this summer, when I took Hack Reactor Remote Prep, and studied for the Hack Reactor interview process.


Fun random stuff?
I love music and going to shows, and I am a hockey fan (go Rangers!). I love exploring new cities so I’m looking forward to getting to know SF with all of you. Hopefully we won't be too busy/wiped out to hang out together on Sundays!




John Domingo


Preferred name (first and last, and proper pronunciation for either or both if needed  it helps so much!)
John Domingo (as in Sunday)


What have you been up to before Hack Reactor? Studied Marine Science at UC Berkeley until 2013 and then applied to work at a small geology lab. Although I didn’t have any of the technical skills to be an analyst, they hired me anyway to help with some data entry and marketing projects. I spent the last two years working my way up as the database administrator and now I’m primarily lab software consultant. Small company though
so there’s a bit of title inflation I guess :p


What city are you coming from to be here at HR?
I've live in Dogtown, Oakland for a little over two years now :) Originally from San Diego!


Tech interests?
I’m interested in data viz, WebGL, machine learning, robotics, mobile dev, and data science. I’m having a blast learning frontend technologies because my current job as a DBA has me looking at tables and tables for days.


Coding experience?
Basic HTML when Xanga was around; Java in high school (although I only retained the OOP concepts); MATLAB and Scheme (dialect of Lisp) in college; and Basic, SQL, Visual Basic + VBA (Access, Excel and Outlook) for work.


Fun random stuff?
I like to cook and bake a lot, although most times it’s a hit or miss :p I really enjoy CrossFit and boxing so I’m a bit sad that I’m going to have to scale back once HR starts. If anyone else is interested, we should keep each other in check! I will be aiming for the 7am classes near 19th street BART on weekdays. I also like to run around Lake Merritt every Sunday :)
