What city are you coming from to be here at HR?
Los Angeles. (Only lived there about three years. Previously a New York City area lifer.)


Tech interests?
I'm fascinated by the way technology changes culture and the economy. It's a cycle that's been going on since before the industrial revolution, but from everything I can see, this time is different. The internet and mobile tech has transformed everything from the way we do business to the way we relate to our loved ones to the very way we think. I'm convinced Peter Thiel is correct when he says "software is eating the world," and so it seems to me the only reasonable thing is to learn how to make it.
I also love any cool gadgets and am interested in machine learning, though I haven't delved into the details.


Coding experience?
High school and a little college comp sci in C++ (fun times). Dabbled in Java when working in video games, but really only to understand what I could ask the engineers to do for me. Rediscovered coding recently in JS and have found it fun to struggle with problems and deeply satisfying to solve them.

 l​ove watching baseball and football/playing golf, tennis and baseball badly
 I'm an equal opportunity nerd: I can go equally deep on Star Wars, Gilmore Girls or pro sports. It's a contradictory mix of interests that confuses even me.

 I'm terrible with names but excellent with details, so I will probably know you deeply as a person before I can easily recall your name. So a lot of: "But your sister's exhusband spent a year abroad in Australia during college, didn't he, ummm... Ralph? Sarah? Who are you?"




Steffen Baumgarten


Preferred name (and proper pronunciation if needed)
Steffen (the „f“ sharp, no Steven„v“) Baumgarten


What have you been up to before Hack Reactor?
I finished my studies in business administration combined with information technology engineering last year. During the times of studies I started all kinds of fun projects like student parties, a fantasy soccer betting platform and an online dating platform for german people 40+. My most serious project, for which I kept working after finishing uni as well, was a company which provided products in the FinTech area, namely direct financing loans for products and services at the point of sale.


What city are you coming from to be here at HR?
Berlin, Germany


Tech interests?
Right now I am looking into two fields most.. (1) How can tech (especially mobile) help people to meet their friends, especially increase meetings by chance or meetings with several people (with different and full schedules) and (2) possibilities of how augmented reality can revolutionize the way of teaching and learning


Coding experience?
Some Java at uni and all the self taught stuff before applying for HR


Fun random stuff?
I am not particularly good at mini golf. There was a nice and sunny day back in 2008 in a little town in the south island of New Zealand though, when the luck was really on my side.. Since then, whenever tourists are coming by in this little town and decide to play a round of mini golf at the local mini golf place, they may wonder who this Steffen Baumgarten is dominating the local hall of fame at that place.

Diamond Wheeler


Preferred name (and proper pronunciation if needed)
Diamond Wheeler (Diamond, pronounced like the stone)


What have you been up to before Hack Reactor?
I’m a biologist, and currently working in a cancer research lab at UCSF. Even though I love the subject, bench work (aka pipetting and carrying out experiments) is a little slow pace and antisocial for me. I’ve been passionate about disease research for a pretty good chunk of my life and I would love to stay in the context of disease if possible.


What city are you coming from to be here at HR?
I’m one of the lucky ones that are already in San Francisco. Good luck to everyone looking
￼for places to stay, I know it’s rough :[


Tech interests?
I’m interested in the code/algorithms behind more permanent medical devices like glucose monitors, insulin pumps, pace makers, etc. These make it possible for people to live more carefree lives despite their conditions. I would love to integrate biology with tech to create/improve on these amazing bionic organs! Since most of these devices are starting have wifi and bluetooth features, security has also become an interesting problem (you don’t want anyone to hack your pace maker...).


Coding experience?
I took a class on java in college for fun. I’ve also done a tiny bit of python for my research (mostly just to save myself a few hours doing mindless work) and mainly all the HR prep!


Fun random stuff?
I fenced for 13 years, so think twice before criticizing my code >:]

Linda Zou


Preferred name (first and last, and proper pronunciation for either or both if needed  it helps so much!)
My name is Ye Zou, but please call me Linda.


What have you been up to before Hack Reactor?
I lived in San Diego for 5 years where I graduated with a major in Environmental Engineering. I'm back in the Bay Area and have recently been dabbling in project management and design as a mechanical engineer for a solar thermal manufacturing company.


What city are you coming from to be here at HR?
I'm currently residing in the Bay area where I grew up and splitting my time between Oakland and Union City.


Tech interests?
In addition to developing the skills required to be a software engineer, I am interested in learning and playing with the DIY electronics platforms such as raspberry pi and arduino. I am also very drawn to the concepts and applications of sustainable energy and its impact on the both developed and developing communities.


Coding experience?
I don't have any real coding experiences or training. I took a random C class in college as part of my major requirement before they decided to phase it out the following quarter. Apart from the topics covered in the HR prep, I also tried to teach myself a bit of python and ruby earlier this year.


Fun random stuff?
I like throwing and catching frisbees. =)
I have 4 dogs, none of whom understand the concept of playing fetch.
I've just recently finished my precourse and have developed a slight dependency on coffee in the process.

Pavel Parshakov


 Preferred name (first and last, and proper pronunciation for either or both if needed  it helps so much!)
Pavel Parshakov (first name pronounced as pAvl and rhymes with gravel; pronunciation of last name is unknown to this day). At Starbucks, I usually go by Ryan, Kyle or Sheldon. Over the phone, my name is usually recorded as Pablo, Vavel or Babel. I can go by any name as long as it is used consistently.


 What have you been up to before Hack Reactor?
I worked as a data analyst for a financial company until March, then I accidentally clicked on Steve Jobs commencement address video on youtube and decided to quit. After burning through most of my savings, I now have a much better understanding of "hungry and foolish”.
Since then I traveled the US a little bit and got somewhat interested in how things are made. Right after failing my first tech interview at HR, I went to China to attend a huge trade show called Canton Fair and visit local manufacturing plants. I came to realize how easy it is for anybody to design and manufacture a product. You can literally draw something on a napkin, pay somebody on Fiver $50 to create a CAD design, send it to a factory in China, get the first prototype two weeks later for the cost of the mould and shipping, and then place a final order once you are satisfied with the finished product. I also realized that most products sold in the US and made in China cost about 10 to 20% of the US price to manufacture.
After China, with my second HR interview coming up, I focused exclusively on chapter 5 of Eloquent Javascript and mastered the .map function in just a few weeks, because while I do believe that failing fast is good, I wanted to at least get to see what the HR program was about and for that I needed to fail slowly.


 What city are you coming from to be here at HR?
I am coming from Atlanta, GA, where it’s still possible to own a 4bedroom house for under $900 in mortgage and taxes. In SF, I am looking forward to sharing a onebedroom apartment with 4 roommates for the same price.


￼ Tech interests?
I am interested in any technology that can improve lives of people on a large scale. If I were smart enough, these would be the areas of interest:
1) Healthcare  imaging devices (like this one h​ttp://www.wired.com/2014/11/butterflynetwork/)​, health monitoring, medical data repository, CRISPR, and cost transparency.
2) Social  finding a way to make it easier for people to gather and maintain a community. I think outside of big cities, it’s really difficult to keep a real connection with people due to the way communities were set up (this is a good but unorthodox video on the topic: https://www.ted.com/talks/james_howard_kunstler_dissects_suburbia)​. I don’t think facebook and upcoming facebook VR can really replace facetoface interaction and for some reason it is still very difficult to organize a meeting faster than a week or two in advance (the m​eetup.com model).
3) Education  we need more of HRtype learning available across different fields. It should not take a 4year degree to change or acquire a career because this creates a lot of inefficiency.
Having mentioned all of this, I will probably end up in tech support at a local social security office.


 Coding experience?
I used Excel and SQL every day in my previous job. Also, a long time ago I got a university degree that was a mix of mathematics and computer science. I was not good at either, but did some programming in now extinct Delphi language.


 Fun random stuff?
I am a minimalist and everything I own fits into a carryon bag.




Tiffany Thong


 Preferred name (first and last, and proper pronunciation for either or both if needed  it helps so much!)
Tiffany Thong (last name, pronounce the 'th' as in 'thing', unless that makes you feel uncomfortable)


 What have you been up to before Hack Reactor?
Had planned on attending medical school and worked in clinical trials for retinal diseases. My working experience helped me realize that I didn't want to work in the clinical setting.


 What city are you coming from to be here at HR?
￼Los Angeles, CA


 Tech interests?
I love seeing the way tech allows users and businesses to operate on a much more efficient level and improve communication. I have several interests that are quiet random such as:
1) health, one of the reasons my last job frustrated me to no end was how outdated most healthcare providers EHR system/software are. I believe it's a sector that still has a lot of need for innovation and production. There's so much potential to transform the health experience in patient care provided it adopts better tech.
2)data science, I love data.
3)fashion, personal longtime interest of mine. I would love to work for a fashion startup/company (eg: something like polyvore before it got bought out by Yahoo).
 Coding experience?
Prep for HR.


 Fun random stuff?
I can speak conversational Spanish, learned to apply what I learned in school towards Spanishspeaking patients.
I love sushi, I can eat it everyday. (if anyone from the bay area knows a great sushi spot, let me know!)
￼I'm trying to teach myself how to memorize people's names really quickly, as I know this will be a useful skill during the first week in HR.




Saumitra Saha


 Preferred name (first and last, and proper pronunciation for either or both if needed  it helps so much!)
My first name is hard to pronounce, but it is easier if you think of it as “ShowMEThrow”
Three easy english words back to back, make the name easy to pronounce: “Show,” “Me,” and “Throw.”


 What have you been up to before Hack Reactor?
I was a caregiver the last few years as both of my parents had cancer. But in terms of training, I am an economist.


 What city are you coming from to be here at HR?
I am coming from Houston Texas, the city of the 2nd tech boom (the first was Los Alamos during WW2). We live here since my father was
involved in the shuttle program. I lived in the Bay Area over a decade ago. It was not cheap then either.


 Tech interests?￼
￼I am interested in how we can use technology to help people do the things that they want to do. I want to use technology to help people become aware of how much technology they use. I don’t want people to feel that they are controlled by technology. For instance, people talk about how they are addicted to Facebook.


 Coding experience?
Mainly using statistical software. I have done a few online courses as well. But if I had to pick a language that I am most comfortable in, that would be C.


 Fun random stuff?
I have lived in Chicago, San Francisco, London, Austin, Toronto, and Houston.
I am NOT a competitive person, and I prefer working with people rather than against them. I enjoy teaching.
I like playing soccer or any sports outside. I find that playing outside with friends is a great way to relax, but it is also really hard to get people to join in.




Joey Chin


 Preferred name (first and last, and proper pronunciation for either or both if needed  it helps so much!)
Joey Chin, here! Last name is pronounced like you would think. Chinny, chin chin!


 What have you been up to before Hack Reactor?
I was web developer/master for a tech company in Los Angeles, and an inner city youth worker in my spare time, meaning I lived and worked in a more￼underserved part of Long Beach to work with the youth.


 What city are you coming from to be here at HR?
Coming from Long Beach, CA! The LBC, Snoop Dogg!! Close to LA.


 Tech interests?
Still discovering these, but I do love the problem solving aspect in programming solutions. Would love to learn ways to integrate helping underserved, lowincome communities and tech.


 Coding experience?
Creating HTML, CSS, and JS at my former work place, and PHP on a CRM side project.


 Fun random stuff?
I love all sports! I'm an avid FC Barcelona fan, love rock climbing, and can't wait to catch some Steph Curry action when I'm up in the Bay. We probably won't have much time, but hit me up if you plan on playing any kind of sport!




Alice Yu


 Preferred name (first and last, and proper pronunciation for either or both if needed  it helps so much!)
Alice Yu, pronounced how it looks. "Yu" is like "You."


 What have you been up to before Hack Reactor?
I was Director of Community at M​eteor,​a nontechnical role in a very technical company. Meteor was a big part of my inspiration to learn programming and JavaScript in particular. I was at Meteor for 2.5 years, beginning as employee #7 as a junior community manager, m o v i n g i n t o a p r i m a r i l y c​o n t e n t ​r o l e l a t e r , a n d￼finally becoming a director with a team of two people.
In a past life, I studied renewable energy, sustainable transportation, and the electrical grid, and attempted to found several illfated startups. My wouldbe products included a new type of solar cooker to help replace woodburning in developing countries, rentable napping pods, and a digital sheet music reader.


What city are you coming from to be here at HR?
I'm lucky... been living in SF for about 3 years, and am currently in a nice classic SF house a block from the 24th and Mission BART. I'll probably host an event there on the occasional Sunday, if you want to check it out!


 Tech interests?
I'm excited about cellphones "leapfrogging" into developing countries, opening the doors for things like mobilebased financial services (e.g. M​Pesa)​. ​Project Loon​is inspiring. I'm also excited about electric cars, selfdriving cars, and related opportunities for cleaner, smarter cities.
I believe AI is going to be a big deal, and am curious about VR/AR, wearables, and personalized health.


 Coding experience?
CS101 in college (Java and Matlab). Took part in a Meteor "app week" in late 2013, during which I built this rudimentary 2D R​ubik's cube simulator.​In June, I decided to m​ake a habit​of programming, and began studying the Hack Reactor resources.


 Fun random stuff?
 For about 10 months, I lived in a​yurt that I built​out of foam boards and tape, in a friend's backyard. I've previously also lived in a backyard tent, a walkin closet, and in many different hackerhouses / intentional communities.
 I l i k e c o m m u t i n g v i a e l e c t r i c l o n g b o a r d . I n t ​h i s v i d e o , ​ t h a t ' s m e i n t h e b l u e h e l m e t a n d b l a c k Meteor backpack.
 I enjoy teaching people how to solve Rubik's cubes, and can teach most people in about 3 hrs. Here's an o​ld website​I put up. I'd be happy to lead a mealtime cubing club for anyone interested.
